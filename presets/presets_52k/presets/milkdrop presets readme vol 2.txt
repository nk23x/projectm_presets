INVENTIVE SOFTWARE'S MILKDROP PRESETS VOL 2: NOT THE USUAL

Dedicated to the might of Liverpool F.C in the Champions League 04/05. Well done boys!

Thank you for downloading Vol 2 of my Milkdrop Presets. There's 20 here, so plenty to check out. If you haven't checked out Vol 1 don't worry, they can be downloaded as well.

I'd like to consider myself an intermediate at preset making. I don't do AVS, because it doesn't run very well on my computer, so Milkdrop is the worthwhile alternative for me! I've had lots of practise with Milkdrop, and these presets show what I am capable of.

All of these presets were created with the default mesh size, 640x480 in 32-bit fullscreen mode, and they should run good at 30 FPS. I have a Geforce FX 5200, so I can't really complain.

Note: All my presets are set with a rating of 5. Change them to what you want. (Or leave them!)

DESCRIPTION OF PRESETS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are listed in order of creation, I think.

COLOUR FEAST IN THE TUNNEL is one that uses the warp and the zoom to good effect. The balls are moved with some code, and the tunnel looks good with the colour trails behind it. One of the best presets in the pack.

RIPPLES IN THE SEARCHLIGHT (COLOUR REMIX) is the RIPPLES IN THE SEARCHLIGHT preset from Volume 1 with some colour changes in the searchlight. The ripples move a little differently to the original, but it's not that significant.

COLOUR FEAST IN THE TUNNEL 2 is based around the first one described above, but it's basically made a lot more beat-driven and faster. My first dab in preset making / changing after a lengthy absence.

SUBTLETY SLOWLY REDEFINED was my first crack at a brand new preset after the lengthy absence mentioned above. It's subtle in it's changes and movements. I enjoy watching this one a lot.

SUBTLETY SLOWLY REDEFINED 2 is my first attempt at circular motion with objects. Apart from that, it's not changed much from the previous version.

LCD WARPED IN THE 5TH DIMENSION uses the stretch motions to good use, and my example of circular motion is there again, as a focal point. The motion vectors are used well. It's a nice preset to look at.

MADNESS TRAPPED IN A WAVEFORM came about with a mix of colours, waves, and warping. It really is madness! Spot the moving object (again). This works really well with something significant, because then the warping comes into it's own. One of my best ever, and I'm never happy with it!

RIPPLES IN THE SEARCHLIGHT (SUBTLETY REMIX) is again based around the RIPPLES IN THE SEARCHLIGHT, but lots of things have been changed. With the way it moves, you'd be hard pressed to notice the difference (hence the subtlety) but it is very addictive to look at. One of my better presets.

UNDECIDED FATE has many things controlling the image you see. Puts custom waves to very good use, and rotation is fairly finely tuned to the beat. Very nice to look at, and one of my best presets that keeps being altered every now and then.

AUDIBLY TWISTED VORTEX uses beat-driven motions a lot. There's lots going on, and it also looks vaguely more twisted the louder the music is. Definitely one of my best presets.

NAKING RIPPLES WITH NOTHING MUCH does what it says on the tin. It's fairly simple and uses heavy warping to twist the waves. Not the best here, but done while I was experimenting with different things.

COLOUR FEAST IN THE TUNNEL 3 uses the "Tan" function to good effect on the tunnel. Things move a little more slowly than previous COLOUR FEAST IN THE TUNNEL presets, but in a strange sadistic way it works.

DOT MATRIX GONE MAD came about when I was experimenting with dotted waves and Vectors. It's quite simple and lacks any complexity. Who says simplicity doesn't work?

THE MYSTERIES OF TURBULENCE uses timing to change the main wave. It was an experiment that looked good at the time. Quite rigourous to look at, don't do so for too long as it may hurt your eyes. Not the best, but not the worst either.

THE FORMING OF IDEALISATION uses many waves of different colours that blend together very nicely. The rotation is beat driven and even works on high volume pieces. Combines smooth motion with turbulence and works well. One of the best here.

THE POWER OF MUSICAL GENIUS is my first preset after a 4 month absence from Milkdrop. The shape in the middle changes rapidly to the beat of the music and is rather effective. I was quite pleased with this one, as it took about an hour to get the effect working nicely.

UNDECIDED FATE 2 was edited from UNDECIDED FATE after a small break. I changed lots of things, and added a few bits to it, and it's now more trippy than ever, as if Milkdrop needed more trippy presets(!).

TRIPPY GEOMETRICS was another edited preset, this time from MATHEMAGICAL MADNESS, in Volume 1. This time, I went all out and changed just about everything, and experimented with the video alpha. Was originally gonna be called "THE WAY MATHS LESSONS SHOULD BE", cause that's how I'd have liked them.

THE POWER OF MUSICAL GENIUS 2 was adapted from THE POWER OF MUSICAL GENIUS. I changed just about everything here, and added some custom waves. It's more beat driven than ever, and so subtle in some of the changes. One of my better presets.
